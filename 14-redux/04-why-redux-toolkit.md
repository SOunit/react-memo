- まだ redux-toolkit 使ってないの？
  https://akfm.dev/blog/2020-06-26/redux-toolkit.html

# points

- redux is useful but have to include a lot of packages

  - デバッグ：redux-devtools-extension
  - 設計：ducks, reducks, redux-way
  - 非同期処理：redux-thunk, redux-saga
  - immutable 系：immer, immutablejs
  - utility：redux-actions, typescript-fsa
  - その他：normalizr, reselect

- redux-saga is great for controlling complex state management

  - but too much for simple state app

- redux-tool-kit is official setup for easy use redux functions

  - follow best practice by official
  - less personal setup
  - standard approach

- recoil was released too. new approach to state management
  - curious which will be popular, redux-tool-kit or recoil
